Made a business analytics project on CVS Health Corporation after the Aetna acquisition and during COVID-19.
Ran a sentiment analysis of the market experts' expectations from the Aetna acquisition and COVID-19. Ran regression models and predictions for the stock price to see how it performed relative to CVS's own and the market expertsâ€™ forecasts.
Assessed the company's capabilities and the value chain in order to have a full picture of the company's strategy, CVS's intentions, and plans for the future given the pandemic and Aetna's presence.
